# carvewith.us

A project for ski & snowboard lovers.

## Development
### Local Environment Setup
Assume that you are using Mac OS X Snow Leopard (this means you will have python and related tools installed):

1. Install Pyramid framework by following [this](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/1.0/narr/install.html#installing-pyramid-on-a-unix-system).
2. Install Mysql Community Server 5.1 64-bit from [here](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html). Make sure that you install 64-bit, not 32-bit.

## Open Questions
* Do we really need car info from user?
* What's the relationship between our users? Friends or followers? (Follower case, this guy is awsome and I  like to follow him when he goes to snowboarding)
* Other than ski/snowboard, do we need any other preference/interests to catch?
* Shall we start with fixed list of places for ski and fixed places for lodging? (maybe i think too much, so we can potentially get a cut?) A fixed list of ski places makes sense for now. Or for now it could be just as simple as need lodge or not. (btw, hotels.com and similar sites provide affiliate program).
