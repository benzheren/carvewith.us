# carvewith.us

A project for ski & snowboard lovers.

## Development
### Local Environment Setup
Assume that you are using Mac OS X Snow Leopard (this means you will have python and related tools installed):

1. Install Pyramid framework by following [this](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/1.0/narr/install.html#installing-pyramid-on-a-unix-system).
2. Install Mysql Community Server 5.1 64-bit from [here](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html). Make sure that you install 64-bit, not 32-bit.

## Open Questions
* What's the relationship between our users? Friends or followers? (Follower case, this guy is awsome and I  like to follow him when he goes to snowboarding)
* Other than ski/snowboard, do we need any other preference/interests to catch?

## Possible Features
1. Lodging affiliate
2. Money management
3. Personal car info
4. Coming/New trips near you with push notification
