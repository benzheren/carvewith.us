Description: Overview
        ========
        
        Chameleon is an HTML/XML template language compiler.
        
        The distribution comes with a complete template engine: Chameleon Page
        Templates [1]_.
        
        There are no external library dependencies [2]_. You can install it
        using setuptools or the newer `distribute
        <http://packages.python.org/distribute/>`_ (recommended)::
        
        $ easy_install Chameleon
        
        Formatted `documentation <http://repoze.chameleon.org/docs/latest>`_
        is available.
        
        Platform
        ---------
        
        This library has been successfully tested on the following platforms:
        
        * Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7
        * Python 3.1, 3.2
        * PyPy
        
        What's New in 2.x
        ------------------
        
        The 2.x series is a complete rewrite of the library and supports both
        Python 2.5+ and Python 3.1+ with a single source code.
        
        For most users it should be an easy upgrade, however note that at
        present, there is no engine for the Genshi language.
        
        New parser
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This series features a new parser, implemented in pure Python. It
        parses both HTML and XML inputs (the previous parser relied on the
        expat system library and was more strict about its input).
        
        Language changes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The 2.x engine matches the output of the reference implementation more
        closely (usually exactly). There are less differences altogether; for
        instance, the method of escaping TALES expression (usually a
        semicolon) has been changed to match that of the reference
        implementation.
        
        This series also introduces a number of new language features:
        
        1) Support for the ``tal:on-error`` from the reference specification
        has been added.
        
        2) Inspired by the Genshi language, a pair of new attributes has been
        added: ``tal:switch`` and ``tal:case``, allowing flexible conditions.
        
        Expression engine
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The expression engine has been redesigned to make it easier to
        understand and extend.
        
        The engine is built on the ``ast`` module (available since Python 2.6;
        backports included for Python 2.5).
        
        Performance
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The compiler output has been optimized for complex templates. For most
        applications, the engine should perform similarly to the 1.x
        series.
        
        Very simple templates with tight loops (such as that of the "big
        table" benchmark) will see a decrease in performance. The compiler is
        optimized for dynamic variable scope and this lowers performance for
        templates that require only a static scope.

        Notes
        -----
        
        .. [1] The template language specifications and API for the Page
        Templates engine are based on Zope Page Templates (see in
        particular `zope.pagetemplate
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.pagetemplate>`_). However,
        the Chameleon compiler and Page Templates engine is an entirely
        new codebase, packaged as a standalone distribution. It does
        require a Zope software environment.
        
        .. [2] The string translation interface is based on the `gettext
        <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html>`_
        library. Chameleon comes with built-in support for the
        `zope.i18n <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.i18n>`_ package
        which includes a translation framework
        (internationalization). If this package is installed, it will
        be used as the default translation framework. It is trivial to
        provide a custom translation function, however.

        Changes
        =======
        
        2.0-rc5 (2011-03-07)
        --------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Fixed a number of issues concerning the escaping of attribute
        values:
        
        1) Static attribute values are now included as they appear in the
        source.
        
        This means that invalid attribute values such as ``"true &&
        false"`` are now left alone. It's not the job of the template
        engine to correct such markup, at least not in the default mode
        of operation.
        
        2) The string expression compiler no longer unescapes
        values. Instead, this is left to each expression
        compiler. Currently only the Python expression compiler unescapes
        its input.
        
        3) The dynamic escape code sequence now correctly only replaces
        ampersands that are part of an HTML escape format.
        
        Imports:
        
        - The page template classes and the loader class can now be imported
        directly from the ``chameleon`` module.
        
        Features:
        
        - If a custom template loader is not provided, relative paths are now
        resolved using ``os.abspath`` (i.e. to the current working
        directory).
        
        - Absolute paths are normalized using ``os.path.normpath`` and
        ``os.path.expanduser``. This ensures that all paths are kept in
        their "canonical" form.
        
        
        2.0-rc4 (2011-03-03)
        --------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Fixed an issue where the output of an end-to-end string expression
        would raise an exception if the expression evaluated to ``None`` (it
        should simply output nothing).
        
        - The ``convert`` function (which is configurable on the template
        class level) now defaults to the ``translate`` function (at
        run-time).
        
        This fixes an issue where message objects were not translated (and
        thus converted to a string) using the a provided ``translate``
        function.
        
        - Fixed string interpolation issue where an expression immediately
        succeeded by a right curly bracket would not parse.
        
        This fixes issue #5.
        
        - Fixed error where ``tal:condition`` would be evaluated after
        ``tal:repeat``.
        
        Features:
        
        - Python expression is now a TALES expression. That means that the
        pipe operator can be used to chain two or more expressions in a
        try-except sequence.
        
        This behavior was ported from the 1.x series. Note that while it's
        still possible to use the pipe character ("|") in an expression, it
        must now be escaped.
        
        - The template cache can now be shared by multiple processes.
        
        
        2.0-rc3 (2011-03-02)
        --------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Fixed ``atexit`` handler.
        
        This fixes issue #3.
        
        - If a cache directory is specified, it will now be used even when not
        in debug mode.
        
        - Allow "comment" attribute in the TAL namespace.
        
        This fixes an issue in the sense that the reference engine allows
        any attribute within the TAL namespace. However, only "comment" is
        in common use.
        
        - The template constructor now accepts a flag ``debug`` which puts the
        template *instance* into debug-mode regardless of the global
        setting.
        
        This fixes issue #1.
        
        Features:
        
        - Added exception handler for exceptions raised while evaluating an
        expression.
        
        This handler raises (or attempts to) a new exception of the type
        ``RenderError``, with an additional base class of the original
        exception class. The string value of the exception is a formatted
        error message which includes the expression that caused the
        exception.
        
        If we are unable to create the exception class, the original
        exception is re-raised.
        
        2.0-rc2 (2011-02-28)
        --------------------
        
        - Fixed upload issue.
        
        2.0-rc1 (2011-02-28)
        --------------------
        
        - Initial public release. See documentation for what's new in this
        series.
